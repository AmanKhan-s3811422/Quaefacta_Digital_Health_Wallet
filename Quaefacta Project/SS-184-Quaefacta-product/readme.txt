The Client is wishing to conserve AWS costs, and as a result the live deployment on AWS is currently not up.

To get the app running, follow the readme.md for the frontend (/FrontEnd/)and the backend (Backend/OldSpringboot/).

======= FRONTEND
Ensure that you are in the FrontEnd/queafacta folder.

Run the command npm install.

Then run the command npm start.

The app should now be running!


======= BACKEND
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/

You will need to have MySQL installed and running on your system.

Ensure that the credentials that you have are correct.

Run the BackEnd\OldSpringboot\src\main\java\com\quaefactahealth\vaxapp\VaccineApplication.java file.

Your backend should now be up and running!


====== Points 2 and 5

No credentials for a live service because The Client wouldn't want to share them, as it commercially private information.
